- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @youma64
- Iâ€™m interested in C and C#, lua, and I little bit of java and python !
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never finished every project I started :(
- currently a student (I don't know the english reference for all grades because I don't even know what graduate mean since I have one but idk which one are ya talking about)
- Aside from being a dev/gamedev, I also play trombone for 10 years now (as of 2025), and train myself for 3D modeling and texturing.

- Did you know how many stars are in the universe we live in ?, 200 billion trillion; 
So you can't tell me its impossible to rise and shine some days.
